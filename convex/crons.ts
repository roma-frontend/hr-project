/**
 * Cron registration entry point.
 *
 * Convex only picks up scheduled jobs from `convex/crons.ts` — a `cronJobs()`
 * object exported from any other module is never registered. Jobs defined
 * elsewhere in this directory (see `hrCronJobs.ts`, `backups.cron.ts`) are
 * therefore dormant until they are wired in here.
 *
 * Every job runs through `operatorTools.dispatchCron`, the single gate that
 * honours the operator's pause flag (Scheduled Ops console) and records
 * `lastRunAt` / outcome on the registry row. Pausing a job in the console
 * therefore actually stops its next scheduled fire — no deploy needed.
 * The job key is passed as args so the dispatcher knows which job to run.
