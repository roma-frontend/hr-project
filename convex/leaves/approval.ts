/**
 * Who decides a leave request.
 *
 * BEFORE
 *   Approval was a rank check: any `admin` or `supervisor` could approve any
 *   request anywhere in the organization, `supervisorId` appeared zero times in
 *   this folder, there was no self-approval guard at all, and the "new request"
 *   notification fanned out to every `admin` — so a supervisor who actually
 *   managed the requester was never told, while admins with no relationship to
 *   them were.
 *
 * NOW
 *   1. Nobody reviews their own request, and nobody reviews a request they filed
 *      on someone else's behalf (the rule `convex/expenses.ts` already applies to
 *      money: nobody signs off on what they claimed).
 *   2. The approver is the nearest manager in the requester's reporting line who
 *      holds `leave.approve`.
 *   3. A holder of `leave.approve.org` (HR / admin) may approve anyone in the
 *      organization — except the head, whose request follows the head policy.
 *   4. The head of the organization has no ancestor, so `organizations.headApproval`
 *      decides: `auto` (default) records it approved with an audit note,
 *      `delegate` routes it to a named person, `peer` lets another
 *      `leave.approve.org` holder decide.
