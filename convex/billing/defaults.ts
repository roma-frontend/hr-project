/**
 * Billing defaults — the out-of-the-box Starter/Pro/Enterprise matrix.
 *
 * Shared by:
 *   - the seed mutation (writes them into Convex),
 *   - the entitlements engine (code-level fallback when no billing tables
 *     exist yet — keeps enforcement working from day one without a seed).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: enforcement uses these defaults ONLY when the billing catalog has
 * never been seeded. Once the superadmin publishes plans, the published
 * snapshots are the single source of truth.
